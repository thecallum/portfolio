# Todo list

- Find link icon for Live demo and HithubRepository links
- Normalise spacing on mobile
- Decide on accent colour (probably either lime or purple)
- Get spacing working on other widths
- Experiment with different fonts (inter is pretty good. But I kinda want to use a font pair. Heading looks better if different font)
